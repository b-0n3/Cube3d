I need a WIX installer that can oneclick install an application for our customer.
The entire installer will include the installation of SQL Server Express 2019, SQL Server Management Studio,
a C# Application and a Windows Service.

That would all be to much for one first order therefore your part will be to start with
Part 1 a,b,c and 2



Part 1. 

1   SQL Server Express 2019
	a.) Restore a Database bak file (= run skript)
	b.) Create a user
	c.) Installationoptions
		i.Instancename "SmartInventory"
		ii SQL Browser Service install/start (otherwise no acces on instances allowed)
	d.) Acces Via TCP/IP (not part of this order but perhaps a followup order if this order goes well)
	e.) FirewallPort Acces (SQL Browser Instance) (not part of this order but perhaps a followup order if this order goes well)
	
2	Installation of SQL Server Management Studio
	If possible accesible via remote maintenance
	
Note: I will send you the bak file once you accept the offer.
